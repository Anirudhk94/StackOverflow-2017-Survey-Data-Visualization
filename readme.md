# School Donations Data Visualization

## Demo

## Overview

### What is this app for?

An interactive data visualization that represents...

### What does it do?

visualize data in charts, graphs, etc. Filter data...etc. (more details will follow)

### How does it work

The app uses D3.js and DC.js to renders charts from a large MongoDB database and uses Crossfilter.js to allow exploration of the datasets for analysis. The charts are styled with Dc.css and then bootstrap is used in conjuction with keen.js & keen-dashboards.css to layout the dashboard elements.

Flask is used for building the server that interacts with MongoDB and renders the HMTL page that contains our charts.

The following data collection attributes/fields will be used as the basis of the project:

- Languages used
- Frameworks, tools, etc used
- education
- career satisfaction
- etc.

## App Features
 
### Existing Features
